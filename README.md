This is an from scratch implementation of cnn 

```cnn_manual.py ```contains scratch implementation of a cnn layer 
and ```cnn_part2.py``` contains scratch implementation of cnn net.

I don't recommend running both since it would take eternity to run since they are not optimized.

You may run ```cnn_using_modules.py``` it shows how to train a cnn network and how to save it. the model is trained on cifar-10 dataset

How to run this code 
```
git clone 
pip install torch, torchvision, numpy
python cnn_using_modules.py
```

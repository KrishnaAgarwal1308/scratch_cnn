this is an from scratch implementation of cnn 
file cnn_manual.py contains scratch implementation of a cnn layer 
and cnn_part2.py contains scratch implemenattion of cnn net
i dont recommend running both since it would take eternaty to run since they are not optimized
you may run cnn_using_modules.py it shows how to train a cnn network and how to save it. the model is trained on cifar-10 dataset
